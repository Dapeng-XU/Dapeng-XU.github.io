    <h1>CG Final Project: Details</h1>
    <br />
    <h3 class="content-block-title">Objective</h3>
    <p>Null. </p>
    <h3 class="content-block-title">Part 1: Architecture</h3>
    <p>From the top view of this project, we will run ray tracing several times for each pixel, and next compute the average
        color, drawing this pixel. All pixels are filled one by one. So implementing ray tracing in the global scene, we
        must need to create the canvas element first, then get and use the canvas 2D context. </p>
    <pre class="brush: javascript">
        DOM = document.getElementById('canvas-2d-wheel');
        context = DOM.getContext('2d');
    </pre>
    <p>All code relative to this final project has been included in only one JavaScript file, located in js/finalWheel.js. </p>

    <h3 class="content-block-title">Part 2: General Problem about Canvas 2D</h3>

    <p class="content-block-subtitle-1">2.1 What functions do the canvas 2D API contains?</p>
    <p>For generality, all the functions called in this projected are well supported by lots of modern browsers, and another
        condition these functions satisfied is that they are described by some web standard. The former condition keeps the
        compatibility, the last condition condition confirms the function will have been supported by lots of platform for
        a long term. </p>
    <p>The sets of this kind of functions in canvas rendering 2D context are[1]: drawing rectangles, drawing text, line
        styles, text styles, fill and stroke styles, gradients and patterns, shadows, paths, drawing paths, compositing,
        the canvas state. Note that all functions listed will not be used in this project.</p>

    <p class="content-block-subtitle-1">2.2 How do we deal with the canvas resizing correctly?</p>
    <p>If we consider the canvas elements as a sort of normal HTML element, we will make a mistake. We should understand
        canvas a little more. That is to say, there is a buffer attached to each canvas element in the memory. Every time
        we draw something on the canvas, it will first modify the buffer, then the buffer will be drawn on the canvas element.
        Therefore, when a canvas resizing, the default manner is resize the canvas element, but keep the size of the buffer
        same as ever. The key is we should manually update the size of buffer. </p>
    <p>It is implemented in dpConvas2D.setPosition(). If you would like to get more details, see [2]. </p>

    <p class="content-block-subtitle-1">2.3 Is there any library you used? And what are they? </p>
    <p>This project is so important that it is the final project of the class computer graphics, of which the contents
        are really interesting. While we are supposed not to make a wheel and always to make full use of our life time to
        do meaningful things, the THREE.js library is used again. THREE.js provided a set of mathematical objects and
        functions with full abilities, even the bounding box, the detecting intersection, and the interpolation are
        implemented. </p>
    <p>I guarantee for no using out of the basic mathematical functions, and you can also check the code. </p>
