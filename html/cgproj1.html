    <h3 class="content-block-title">My view on computer graphics</h3>
    <p>
        As this homepage is first established for the assignment of the course
        <span class="content-block-definition">Computer Graphics</span>(<span class="content-block-definition">CG</span>)
        and this is one task of it, another task I need to finish below is to show how my view about computer graphics.
    </p>
    <p>
        CG is interesting. The results of computer graphics are intuitive and vivid, which gives me
        a sense of achievement. Furthermore, by the abundant interaction and feedback, we can always enjoy exploring
        the CG world and improve our work easily.
    </p>
    <p>
        CG is still in development. In recent years, VR and AR set up a new approach to information, and screens
        became thinner and cheaper, put into pockets and in every corner. Cameras are embedded into mobile phones,
        cars and glasses, supporting video capture and even direct 3D modeling. Moreover, the performance of
        the video cards have been growing rapidly, cards catering for the calculation of more complex effects.
    </p>
    <p>
        CG is an subject based on practice but deeply rely on mathematics. Both of practice and mathematics are the
        important and powerful tools for computer graphics. As a learner, we need to make full use of them.
    </p>
    <br />
    <p>
        All above is my view about CG. However, I am a person new in CG, so if you have a better idea or an
        interesting problem on CG, and you are willing to share with me, please contact me~
