% Structuring a talk is a difficult task and the following structure
% may not be suitable. Here are some rules that apply for this
% solution:

% - Exactly two or three sections (other than the summary).
% - At *most* three subsections per section.
% - Talk about 30s to 2min per frame. So there should be between about
%   15 and 30 frames, all told.

% - A conference audience is likely to know very little of what you
%   are going to talk about. So *simplify*!
% - In a 20min talk, getting the main ideas across is hard
%   enough. Leave out details, even if it means being less precise than
%   you think necessary.
% - If you omit details that are vital to the proof/implementation,
%   just say so once. Everybody will be happy with that.

\section{Introduction}

\begin{frame}{Several Questions}
	\begin{itemize}
		\item
		One-pass or two-pass?
		\item
		LOWPOINT?
		\item
		Ear decomposition?
		\item
		Compele version?
		\item
		Robbin's Theorem?
	\end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\section{Strong Components}

\subsection{Thinking about Strong Components}

\begin{frame}{Review: What have we learned from the textbook?}
	\begin{itemize}
		\item
		Run DFS twice. Once on the original graph $G$, once on the \emph{tranposition} of $G^T$.
		\item
		The trick is using \emph{finishing times} of each vertex computed by the first DFS.
		\item
		Linear time complexity: $O(V+E)$
	\end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{Questions}
	\begin{itemize}
		\item
		"Equivalently the strong component graph is the acyclic digraph,
		formed by contracting vertices of G, that has an many vertices as possible."
		What is the meanings of this sentence?
	\end{itemize}
\end{frame}
